# weather-dashboard

## Description
* Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. I am challenged  to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
